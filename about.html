                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a senior majoring in Biology and minoring in Chemistry. I hail from Kerala, a southern state in India. I started working as a photographer for the Berea College Multimedia Team in the Spring of 2022. As a STEM major, I enjoys working in Multimedia because it provides me with a platform to express my artistic side. 
                    I have always had a great appreciation for visual arts. I have taken many photos of landscapes while hiking in Berea and traveling. During the 2020 pandemic, I began to explore this interest and enjoy the creative process of composing and editing photos. Since joining the photography team, I have gotten to work closely with Berea staff to enhance my technical and creative abilities and gain more experience working with lighting and camera equipment. Over time, this has allowed me to focus my abilities on niche interests such as light painting and b&w photography.</p>
